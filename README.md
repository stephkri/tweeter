# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone.

This repository is the starter code for the project; I have forked and cloned this repository, then built upon it to learn more about HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX on the front end, and Node, Express and MongoDB on the back end.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository, then clone your fork of this repository.
2. Install dependencies using the `npm install` command.
3. Start the web server using the `npm run local` command. The app will be served at <http://localhost:8080/>.
4. Go to <http://localhost:8080/> in your browser.

## Dependencies

- Express
